## Memory Game Project

In this section, we'll build a progressive web app (PWA) that tests your memory with a card-matching game. This project will demonstrate:

1. React state management with hooks
2. Using the Context API for global state
3. Implementing drag-and-drop functionality  
4. Creating animations with CSS and React
5. Building for offline use as a PWA
